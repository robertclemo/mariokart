# mariokart
A demonstration of CSS
I followed a tutorial online and then tweaked it to suit my screen size, and my desire for Lakitu instead of a plain cloud.  Currently working on
making the background scroll with the characters, and changing the sky to be blue.  Need to change Lakitu to be transparent. Currently, he has a 
white background that I had to change the sky to match.
